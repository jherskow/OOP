=           Design           =
==============================
I decided to design SpaceShip as an abstract class, leaving only the DoAction method unimplemented.

This allows for easy extensibility, since a new ship type needs only implement this method.

This design also allowed for a minimal amount of code duplication:
Useful methods, such as one that finds the angle to the closest ship,
 are part of the abstract class. This allows for modularity, enabling the author of a new type
to use these often-helpful methods when creating their doAction.

In terms of modularity, the current scheme keeps matters relatively straightforward,
since there is only one parent class to worry about besides the supplies classes given.

I feel that my design is intuitive since it allows


==============================
=   Implementation Issues    =
==============================
To save on code, all ships use the regular AI ship image, except for humanShip, which
overrides the main method.

The rechargeEnergy method also helps make it as simple as possible to create new types. since it
is implemented in the abstract class. However, one possible fallback is that a type creator might forget
to call it in his doAction.

==============================
-- DRUNKARD --
Rather than having erratic and completely random ship movements, I wanted a more natural feel
for the drunk ship.

By implementing a timer, I was able to have the ship make turns in a random direction and accelerate
for a few moments, and then coast until the captain drunkenly turns the till again.

-- SPECIAL --

I'm a huge Trekkie, so this choice was a no brainer.

In accordance with the show, the federation vessel does not actively seek conflict.
It will also intelligently raise shields whenever it is in a nearby ship's sights.

However, if attacked, the combination of the aggressive ship's strategy and the intelligent auto-shield
make the federation ship a formidable if not near-invincible enemy.
- The player would be wise to carefully consider before attacking a federation starship,
  perhaps it would be best to wait until other ships are
  in the area.
