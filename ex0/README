= README for ex0:   Knessetâ„¢       =
====================================
A straightforward introductory exercise in the Java Language.
The bugs and compilation errors encountered in this exercise
are meant to artistically convey the staggering extent
of the ineptitude of the Israeli Legislature to the students.

==============================
=      File Description     =
==============================

KnessetMember.Java
    - A class representing a Knesset member and his legislative tendencies.

Law.Java

Assembly.Java
    - A class representing a legislative session of the Knesset. Keeps track of laws, and the
      Knesset members that will back them, with a "suggest" functionality to assist the poor sods.

==============================
=           Design           =
==============================
All api methods are public, and almost all other objects are private,
since we were instructed not to worry about public/private in this exercise.
And i don't quite know how to do it yet either.

The exceptions are the modifier fields for KnessetMember law support.

==============================
=   Implementation Issues    =
==============================
A few elements of the API seem to go unused, but i have left them in.
