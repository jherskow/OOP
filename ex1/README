This section contains a list of the program files you submit. The
description of each file starts on a new line, and contains its name and a short
description (1-2 lines) of its content.

==============================

=== Competition: ===
- playTurn returns an flag signifying the game status. This makes for a simple playRound.

=== Player: ===
- in produceRandomMove, i opted for an approach that always runs in constant time:
   any move is possible, but further into the game this would require many loops to achieve
   a fully random AND legal move. Instead, if the random move is illegal, the method opts
   for the next unmarked stick. This allows the program to run 1 million Random v. Random
   Rounds in about 3 seconds.


==============================
=   Implementation Issues    =
==============================

=== General: ===
In order to make the code more readable,
I decided to leave the messages to the user as string literals.
In most cases, since the messages include variables,
the alternative approach would use a print format,
and make the purpose of some messages harder to discern.

=== Competition: ===
- scoreTally is an int[] with 3 places so that scores can be accessed directly by playerID.

== Explain your implementation of the Smart player: ==

 The implementation i used is based on the fact that we always want to try and hand our opponent an odd
 number of unmarked sticks.

 In the base case, this leaves our opponent with 1 stick, and he is forced to lose.

 So we check and see:
 - If we are handed an odd board, we try to remove 2 to keep it odd.
 - If we are handed an even board, we remove 1 to make it odd.

 Honestly, I was quite surprised how often this player beats the random player.

 But this is probably more of a testament to the stupidity of the random player
 than to any intelligence of my own.
